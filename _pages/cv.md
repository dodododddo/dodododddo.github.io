## Education

### **Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen**, Guangdong, China  
**2022 - Present**  
*B.S.* in Computer Science and Technology (Expected 2026)

## Experience

### **Visiting Student**  
**Oct. 2024 -- Present**  
*IGL-HKUST* - Real-time Novel View Synthesis  
- Focused on generalizable feedforward 3DGS for real-time human novel view synthesis.
- Aimed to introduce dynamic scene priors to reduce reliance on depth supervision, SMPLX models, and narrow baseline between source views.
- Improved temporal coherence in synthesized results.

### **Undergraduate Researcher**  
**Oct. 2023 -- Nov. 2024**  
*HITSZ-ICES* - Parameter Efficient Finetuning & Few-shot Learning  
- Initially worked on few-shot learning, using support set information as context or visual prompts for the ViT model to guide feature extraction and prototype generation.
- Later focused on parameter-efficient fine-tuning, combining parameter selection with reparameterization techniques, and exploring gradient projection and computation decoupling.
- **Publication Status:** One paper on PEFT accepted to **CVPR 2025** (second author). Previously submitted a few-shot learning paper to IJCAI 2024. The paper has been resubmitted to PR and is currently under review.

### **Project Leader**  
**May. 2024 -- Nov. 2024**  
*Project: Multimodal Risk Content Recognition Based on LLMs*  
- Led the project to win the **National Second Prize** in the 19th Challenge Cup Special Competition.
- **Main Contribution:** A multimodal risk content detection framework that explicitly decouples the perception and inference stages, significantly reducing hallucination while improving detection robustness.
- **Main Responsibilities:** LLM inference enhancement (e.g., RAG/CoT), inference optimization (e.g., prefix caching), and LLM-based data synthesis and selection.
