## About Me

I'm a **Junior** student at [Harbin Institute of Technology (Shenzhen), China](https://www.hitsz.edu.cn/), majoring in Computer Science and Technology. My current research interests include:

- Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning
- Few-shot Learning
- 3D Vision, particularly in **3D Representation** such as 3DGS and NeRF, with a focus on generalizable methods
- LLM reasoning and planning

I am privileged to be mentored by Professor [Baoquan Zhang](http://faculty.hitsz.edu.cn/zhangbaoquan), under whose guidance I am working on a project focused on Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning. During my research in his lab, I had the opportunity to contribute to a paper that has been accepted at CVPR 2025, marking a significant milestone in my academic journey.

Additionally, I am interning at the **Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)** under the guidance of Professor [Yuan Liu](https://liuyuan-pal.github.io/)), where I am working on a project related to **feedforward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)** for generalizable and real-time novel view synthesis of human. This project aims to push the boundaries of real-time 3D reconstruction and rendering.

As an undergraduate student, I am continuously expanding my knowledge in various fields to broaden my perspective and explore my research interests further. I am expected to complete my bachelor's degree in 2026 and plan to apply for a PhD program at that time.
